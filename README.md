Welcome to my project!

This is a simple project who I'm using Laravel and Blade templates to make a simple to do list. With this code you can organize your tasklists, adding, editing, marking as done or deleting your tasks in your time.

For use this project, you need only to run your docker environment in the root of the project where a file called docker-compose.yml are located and configured to up the container service to make this project available for you in your localhost. After Docker's container runs as well, you'll be able to access the project typing 'localhost' in your web browser and voila, you now can make and sort your own tasklist.

In this project I'm using PHP, Laravel, Docker, Artisan, Blade templates, Controllers, Views, Routes, Request Validation and Query Builder to interact with the database (who is MySQL).

Soon as possible I'll include a migration to make the table needed to run this project, and you'll need only to run php artisan migrate and have this project running perfectly in your environment. I hope you can enjoy my project and if you want to contact me:
